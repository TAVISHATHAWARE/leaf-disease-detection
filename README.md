# Leaf Disease Detection

This is a deep learning model that predicts if the plant is diseased or healthy by analysing leaf images of the plant. Model was trained on the dataset containing leaf images of cauliflower, mango & tomato. Classifier used were Inception V3 and VGG-16 for predicting if leaf is diseased or healthy.

The dataset has 20 classes, which includes healthy images of Mango, Tomato, and Cauliflower, and diseased images of all these.

## Getting started
### Pre-requisites
To run the model, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need to install the following libraries:

1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. OpenCV
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. Pandas
7. os

### Installing 
To install the model, simply clone this repository to your local machine, use the code below:

-$ git clone https://github.com/TavishaThaware/leaf-disease-detection.git

### Usage
To use the model, you can run the app.py file. This will open a tab on your browser where you can select an image of a leaf to test the model. The model will then classify the leaf as healthy or diseased, and display the results on the screen.

### Contributing
If you find any bugs or issues with the model, feel free to open an issue on this repository. You can also submit a pull request if you have any improvements or new features you would like to add.
